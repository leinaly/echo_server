### Key Features:

- **Dynamic endpoint creation**: Easily create mock HTTP endpoints that respond with predefined data.
- **Endpoint management**: Update and delete existing endpoints.
- **Grape API**: Built using the Grape framework for rapid API development.
- **Authentication**: Secured API requests with API keys.

## Prerequisites

Make sure you have the following installed before setting up the project:

- Ruby version `3.0.1`
- Rails version `6.1.7.8`
- PostgreSQL for the database
- Bundler: `gem install bundler`

## Installation

1. **Clone the repository**:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/echo_server.git
   cd echo_server
   ```
   
2. **Install dependencies**:

    ```bash
    bundle install
    ```
   
## Database Setup
1. **Create the database**:

    ```bash
    rails db:create
    rails db:migrate
    rails db:seed
    ```

## Running the Application

1. **Start the Rails server**:

To start the Rails server on http://localhost:3000, use the following command:
 ```bash
  rails s
 ```

The server will run using Puma and listen on port 3000 by default.

2. **Check app up and running**:

Open url in local browser http://localhost:3000/status if app run successfully response will be as: 
   ```json 
    {"status":"OK"}
   ```

## Running Tests
This project uses RSpec for unit and integration testing.

1. **Run the test suite:**
   ```bash 
      bundle exec rspec
   ```

If you want to run a specific test, use:
   ```
   bundle exec rspec spec/path/to/your/test_file.rb
   ```
2. **Test Coverage:**

The tests ensure that the applicationâ€™s core services, including endpoint creation, update, and deletion, are functioning correctly. 
Unit tests cover individual services, while integration tests ensure the API works as expected.

## Available Endpoints 
Covered in API documentation section

In project root also added postman folder with collection available for import and testing

## Authentication

The API uses API keys for authentication. Each request must include a valid Authorization header

```bash
Authorization: Bearer YOUR_API_KEY
```

To create an API key, use Rails console: 
```ruby
ApiKey.create!(name: 'Test Client', access_token: SecureRandom.hex(20))
```

or get one from the seeds data imported earlier.

To use postman collection :
- copy token to postman authorization section (notice: postman collection does't updated with git pull when already imported in postman client, after git pull it need to be reimported to see changes from repo)
- if needed add additional request headers (example of simpliest request for test - GET  /endpoints)
- perform request and be sure that it was successfull
